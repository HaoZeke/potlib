## [2.0.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.0.0) - 2026-06-26

### Added

- NWChemPot backend: stable message-based C ABI (`nwchem_c_abi.h`), always-built frontend with `dlopen` of optional `libnwchemc`, stub ABI for CI without NWChem, Cap'n Proto `NWChemParams`/`configure @1`, and `potserv ... NWChem`.
- rgpot potentials are now eindir objectives: `rgpot_potential_t` embeds eindir's `eindir_objective_t` as its first member (zero-cost IS-A), with the embedded eval/grad callbacks routed through the rgpot force callback (gradient = -force). rgpot-core consumes `eindir-core` as a shared Cargo crate rather than a prebuilt static lib, so downstream Rust consumers (e.g. `anneal-core`) can minimize an rgpot potential through `eindir_core::Objective<f64>` without a two-Rust-runtime conflict. See `docs/orgmode/howto/eindir-anneal.org`.

### Developer

- CI authoring uses a Nickel `ci/gha/` library with a single hand-maintained
  `ci-orchestrator.yml` for PR/main jobs (prepare/plan, hygiene, build/rust/bridge,
  potentials, CI gate), and nickel-exported workflows only for release, docs,
  cosmo potctl, and doc-commenter. Removed redundant `build`/`prek`/`potentials`/
  `docs_quality`/`towncrier`/`cosmo-potctl-spike` committed workflows in favor of
  the orchestrator plus `gen-gha`/`gha-drift` for the remaining exports. ([#40](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/40))

### Changed

- NWChemPot is now a pure consumer of the split [`nwchemc`](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/nwchemc) engine: the in-tree NWChem embed (`nwchem_c_abi.c`, `nwchem_embed_c_api.f90`, `nwchem_embed_legacy.F`) and the `-Dwith_nwchem`/`-Dnwchem_root`/`-Dnwchem_target` build options are removed. The frontend always builds and `dlopen`s `libnwchemc.so`; the capnp schema is synced byte-for-byte to nwchemc's canonical superset so a flat `NWChemParams` round-trips with no field loss.


## [1.2.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.2.0) - 2026-06-24

### Added

- XTBPot: GFN tight-binding via the xtb C API (GFNFF, GFN0/1/2-xTB). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_xtb=true``. RPC names ``XTB``, ``GFNFF``, ``GFN0xTB``, ``GFN1xTB``. ([#35](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/35))
- TBLitePot: GFN tight-binding via the tblite C API (GFN1, GFN2, IPEA1). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_tblite=true``. ([#36](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/36))
- MetatomicPot: load metatomic TorchScript models directly in C++ (vesin neighbor lists, autograd forces). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_metatomic=true``. Requires vesin 0.5+ (``VesinDevice{VesinCPU, 0}``). ([#37](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/37))
- Units module (``rgpot/units.hpp``): CODATA 2018 constants plus a runtime unit expression parser, with Cap'n Proto ``lengthUnit``/``energyUnit`` negotiation on the RPC boundary. ([#38](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/38))

### Developer

- Lockstep monorepo release via cocogitto 7 + towncrier + ``potctl`` (``potctl/``,
  not published): ``cog bump`` runs ``potctl release sync`` then towncrier then
  ``potctl release assert --require-changelog``; ``release.yml`` publishes
  ``rgpot-core`` on stable ``v*`` tags. CI ``potentials.yml`` builds xtb/tblite and
  metatomic/vesin backends.
- Release tooling in ``potctl`` (Rust workspace crate): lockstep assert
  (meson/CMake/cargo/towncrier/pixi), fail-fast CHANGELOG gate, ``release sync``
  writes all surfaces, cargo publish --locked only, RC tags skip crates.io,
  release-prepare cargo dry-run, SECURITY.md and CODEOWNERS for release surfaces.

### Fixed

- MetatomicPot: target vesin 0.5+ ``VesinDevice`` struct (``{VesinDeviceKind, device_id}``, pass ``VesinDevice{VesinCPU, 0}``) and zero-initialized ``VesinOptions`` (``sorted`` / ``algorithm``).


## [1.1.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.1.0) - 2026-03-29

### Added

- XTBPot: GFN tight-binding potential via xtb (GFNFF, GFN0, GFN1, GFN2). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_xtb=true``. ([#35](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/35))
- TBLitePot: GFN tight-binding potential via tblite (GFN1, GFN2, IPEA1). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_tblite=true``. ([#36](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/36))
- MetatomicPot: ML atomistic models via metatomic/PyTorch with autograd forces and vesin neighbor lists. Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_metatomic=true``. ([#37](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/37))
- Shared unit conversion header (``rgpot/units.hpp``) with CODATA 2018 physical constants for Angstrom/Bohr, Hartree/eV, and Boltzmann conversions. ([#38](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/38))


## [1.0.3](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.3) - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- MSVC/clang-cl compatibility: use ``/W3`` instead of GCC/Clang warning flags and skip ``-lstdc++`` link arg on Windows ([#31](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/31))


## [1.0.2](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.2) - 2026-03-01

### Added

- External integration guide covering namespace collision mitigation when embedding rgpot as a subproject ([#30](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/30))

### Changed

- CI dependency bumps and cleanup to prevent trailing whitespace in generated headers ([#29](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/29))


## [1.0.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.0) - 2026-02-15

### Added

- doc(arch): add architecture guide covering layer diagram, error conventions, and how to register new potentials
- feat(build): add release CI workflow, meson subproject install guards, CMake FetchContent readiness, and package version config
- feat(cache): add a RocksDB integration
- feat(ci): add `rust_tests` job using cargo-nextest on Ubuntu and macOS with default and `--all-features` configurations
- feat(cpp): add C++ RAII wrappers (`include/rgpot/`) — `PotentialHandle`, `InputSpec`, `CalcResult`, `RpcClient`, `Error`, with full Doxygen documentation
- feat(rpc): add feature-gated Cap'n Proto RPC client and server in Rust, sharing the existing `Potentials.capnp` schema with the C++ side
- feat(rpc): initialize a C style integration to the server
- feat(rpc): initialize a server component
- feat(rust): add Rust core library (`rgpot-core/`) with `#[repr(C)]` types, callback-based potential dispatch, status codes, thread-local error handling, and auto-generated C header via cbindgen
- feat(rust): integrate DLPack tensor exchange protocol via `dlpk` crate — core types now use `DLManagedTensorVersioned*` for device-agnostic data exchange, with borrowed (non-owning) and owned tensor helpers in new `tensor` module
- test(rust): add 39 unit tests covering types, status codes, potential lifecycle, C API, null-pointer handling, error propagation, and `free_fn` invocation

### Changed

- chore(build): add Meson `with_rust_core` option, `rust-test` / `rust-test-all` pixi tasks, and `cargo-nextest` dependency

### Fixed

- fix(cpp): remove incorrect `extern "C"` trampolines from `LJPot.hpp` and `CuH2Pot.hpp` that used raw `int` returns and `void*` params; use typed `PotentialHandle::from_impl<>()` template instead
