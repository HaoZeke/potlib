!> Physics checks for the H-in-water star gather, run from pure Fortran so
!! a failure points at the kernel rather than the bindings.
!!
!! Checked: translational invariance of the energy, vanishing net force,
!! agreement between the analytic forces and a central difference of the
!! energy, independence of the energy from the order the water sites
!! arrive in, and rejection of atom lists that are not a water plus H
!! system.
!!
!! The finite-difference check is the one that can fail. Newton's third
!! law holds by construction here (the lone H is handed the negated sum
!! of the legs), so a vanishing net force says nothing about whether the
!! radial derivatives are right; the central difference does.
