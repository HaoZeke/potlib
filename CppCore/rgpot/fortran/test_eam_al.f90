!> Physics checks for the embedded-atom aluminium gather kernel, run from
!! pure Fortran so a failure points at the kernel rather than the bindings.
!!
!! Checked: the force vanishes on the ideal FCC lattice, the net force
!! vanishes on a rattled periodic cell, the energy is translation
!! invariant, and the analytic forces agree with a central difference of
!! the energy. The finite-difference check is the gate on the gather
!! rearrangement: dropping a neighbour's embedding derivative from `f_i`
!! leaves the energy exactly right and the force wrong by order one.

   !! no pair lands within `delta` of the kernel's inner truncation radius,

   !! straddle the step: the outermost FCC shell inside the cutoff sits at
   !! 7.015 Angstrom and the truncation at 7.0996, a gap of 0.085, while a
