* About
This is a set of standard potentials in C++ or Fortran. The goal is to provide
minimal, binding friendly interfaces for ease of usage from Python or even R.

This was originally designed for interfacing easily to potentials implemented [[http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/eon/][in
EON]], but has grown to be more flexible.
